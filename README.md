# Wind-Energy-Output-Prediction
A Jupyter Notebook‚Äìbased project for predicting wind energy output at four different locations using various machine learning models. This repository includes data preprocessing, exploratory visualization, multiple regression algorithms, and performance comparison via bar plots.

## üìù Project Overview
Wind power generation varies with meteorological conditions. This project:

1. **Loads** four CSV datasets (`location1.csv`, `location2.csv`, `location3.csv`, `location4.csv`).
2. **Preprocesses** data: cleaning, missing-value imputation, heatmap correlation
3. **Visualizes** key relationships and distributions.
4. **Trains & compares** five regression models:
   - Linear Regression  
   - Linear Regression with AIC/BIC feature selection  
   - Random Forest Regression  
   - Support Vector Regression (SVR)  
   - Lasso Regression  
5. **Summarizes** model performance in bar plots and exports metrics.
